        "This section of the code implements a `ConversationManager` class. Its primary purpose is to handle the flow of a conversation with a language model, specifically addressing the challenge of managing growing conversation history.Key features include:*\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Adding Messages**: Appends user and assistant messages to a list maintaining the conversation turn by turn.*\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Periodic Summarization**: After a set number of turns (`k`), the entire conversation history is summarized into a concise system message using the Groq API. This summarized system message then replaces the detailed history, effectively reducing the input token count for subsequent API calls while retaining the core context.*  \n",
        "  \n",
        "   **History Truncation**: Provides methods to get a truncated version of the history based on the number of recent turns or a maximum character count, useful for managing context when summarization isn't active or for specific API call requirements.*  \n",
        "\n",
        " **Chat Function**: Orchestrates the process of adding a user message, calling the Groq API with the current history, adding the assistant's response, and triggering summarization when the turn count reaches the specified threshold."

        "This section demonstrates how to use the Groq API's tool-calling capability to extract structured information from unstructured text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Defining a JSON Schema**: A Python dictionary `USER_DETAILS_SCHEMA` is created to specify the structure and types of the data we want to extract (e.g., name, email, phone number, location, age).\n",
        "2.  **Defining a Tool**: A list of tools is created, where each tool is a dictionary describing a function the model can \"call\". In this case, a single tool named `extract_user_details` is defined, linked to the `USER_DETAILS_SCHEMA` as its parameters.\n",
        "3.  **Using the `extract_user_details` Function**: This function takes user text as input and calls the Groq API. It instructs the model (using a system message and `tool_choice`) to use the `extract_user_details` tool to parse the input text.\n",
        "4.  **Parsing Tool Output**: The API's response includes a \"tool call\" object containing the extracted data formatted as a JSON string according to the schema. The function then parses this JSON string into a Python dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is powerful for tasks like extracting entities, filling forms, or structuring information from natural language inputs."
